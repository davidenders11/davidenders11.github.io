In this post, I'll go over how to use an open-source command line tool (CLI) I created to do away with mundane, repetitive email tasks. Check out the source code:

<div class="github-card" data-github="davidenders11/gmail-automation" data-width="400" data-height="" data-theme="default"></div>
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/github-cards/latest/widget.js"></script>

This tool was born out of the frustration of spending unnecessary hours completing extremely repetive tasks on email. So often have I spent time writing basically the same email with minor modifications to a daunting roster of contacts, whether for a personal pursuit or as part of a job I worked. Reaching out to recruit potential speakers for an environmental conference I helped to organize. Emailing professors to ask for permission to enroll in an over-enrolled class. Facilitating fundraising campaigns during my time as President of the Claremont Colleges Ski Club. These are all situations where each email sent is very similar, but a simple copy-and-paste won't suffice, as each email has to be tailored to a unique relationship or context.
